# Matrix Task

This project is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses Redux Toolkit for state management and React Router for routing. The application also supports dark and light themes.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Running the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Setting Up the Proxy Server

This application uses a proxy server to handle requests. To set up the proxy server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `proxy-server` directory (replace `proxy-server` with the actual directory name if it's different).
2. Install the proxy server dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the proxy server with `npm start`.

The proxy server must be running for the application to function correctly. The application is configured to send requests to the proxy server, which then forwards them to the actual server.
